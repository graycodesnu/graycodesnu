# Hi there, I'm Grayson 👋

### I'm a full stack engineer, passionate about code, the Dodgers ⚾️, and the WNBA 🏀. 

### I ♥️ building React apps with beautiful frontends and efficient backends. 

### My favorite thing about coding is the endless learning opportunities!💡

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [My Pets](https://github.com/OurPetProjects/my_pets), a MERN app for keeping track of your pets' feeding schedules, vet appointments, and other important tasks.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion animations, and more about data structures and algorithms. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on an app that utilizes NASA's API or is related to LGBTQ+ issues. (Or both!👽🏳️‍⚧️)

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with studying for technical interviews and getting my foot in the door at my first tech job!🚪

- 💬 Ask me about my dog and cats, working full-time during a coding bootcamp, or my human rights policy research.
